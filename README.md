# Ascent Assessment

Welcome Ascent Applicant!

You have been tasked with creating a Dog Fact App. This is a Flutter application that will generate fun dog facts for our users!

We have provided a general template and the assets for the application but the rest is up to you! This Assesment should take up to 2-3 hours to complete in full.

## Getting Started

We recommend working on Visual Studio Code and learning a little more about Flutter if this is your first time working on such an App.

We would like you to emulate the UI displayed in the following images.

On initialization of the app, the far left UI should be displayed. After pressing the "Shake for Facts!" button, the screens should change to the UI layout on the right. 

Whenever the "Shake For Facts!" button is pressed then a new fact should populate the card.

The heart icon on the lower right of the card should respond to user input, by filling if pressed. 

## Skills Assessed

- Flutter UI design
- File reading/writing 
- Object Oriented Programming

### Bonus Implmentation
If you have some extra time and would like to really impress, we have some extra features you can try to implment.
1. Shake Gesture: A user can shake their mobile device to trigger a new fact to generate.
2. Favorite facts: Create a local file that will log a user's favorite facts, whenever they hit the like button.
